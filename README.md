<br>
<p align="center">The Synchronized Protocols native token WTISDR is a non-dilutive, supply-elastic, utility BEP-20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain.

<p align="center">This is the rebase oracle contract which is used to conduct rebase cycles. The protocol is utilizing the two synchronized rebase input variables - WTI and SDR - as transmitters of the global economic sentiment pulse into DeFi. 
<br><br>Synchronized Protocol "Sprotocol" introduces the first crypto hedge utilizing the Crude Oil WTI futures via Chainlink, which is providing tamper-proof blockchain oracles for hybrid smart contracts. Additionaly, the Synchronized Protocol token is pegged to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR). SDR is an international reserve asset, composed of the U.S. Dollar, Euro, GBP, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen.

<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that this is a supply-elastic utility, it´s architecture allows supply adjustments, or 
rebases, to alter the total supply across the Synchronized Protocol’s network. Therefore the number 
of WTISDR tokens a holder owns may increase or decrease on a daily basis without impacting that 
user’s ownership of the total network. <br></p>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">Below is the contract for the Standard token xWTISDR, which represents a share of WTISDR that is deposited in a token pool that is affected by rebasements, while xWTISDR is unaffected by rebasements. The use of the xWTISDR token is applied on platforms which dont support supply elastic rebase tokens yet.
